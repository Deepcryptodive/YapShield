# YapShield üõ°Ô∏è

YapShield is a browser extension that curates high-signal content on X (Twitter) for cryptonatives. Built from scratch during [SozuHaus](https://x.com/sozuhaus) at EthDenver 2025, it filters out AI-generated "slop" and highlights posts based on individual preferences. A premium "Lock In" mode, gated by [Boys NFT]([url](https://boys.petravoice.art/)) ownership on Mantle, refines the feed further. There are focus modes for yield farming, [Kaito‚Äôs]([url](https://kaito.ai/)) "Emerging Yappers," or broader DeFi terms. Valueble posts by Virtuals' agents are highlighted.

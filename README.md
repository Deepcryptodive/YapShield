# SlopShield

**SlopShield** is a browser extension that filters out low-quality, AI-generated content ("slop") on X while highlighting **DeFi-related posts** for crypto enthusiasts. It features **keyword-based detection**, a DeFi-only filter gated by **Boys NFT ownership on Mantle**, and real-time **Slop Score tracking**, with an AI model planned as a stretch goal for smarter slop detection.
